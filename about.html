        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This interactive web map provides a detailed visualization of car crashes in Seattle, leveraging publicly available datasets to present a comprehensive overview of traffic incidents. By offering insights into crash trends, severity, and contributing factors, the project aims to improve public awareness and assist in data-driven urban planning decisions.
            The map specifically focuses on crash data from the years 2016 and 2020 to highlight changes in traffic patterns before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can interact with the map to explore these trends, utilizing various filtering tools and visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into traffic safety issues.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            We cleaned and formatted the datasets by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing data, standardizing attributes, and filtering relevant incidents. 
            Cleaned datasets are stored in the <code>cleanedData/</code> folder.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increase public awareness:</strong> By making crash data accessible and interactive, the project helps Seattle residents better understand road safety risks in their area.</li>
            <li><strong>upport Data-Driven Urban Planning:</strong> City planners and transportation officials can utilize the insights derived from the data to enhance infrastructure and implement safety measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Road Safety for Drivers and Commuters:</strong> By identifying high-risk intersections and common crash causes, the project allows drivers to make informed decisions about their routes and behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The interactive map will feature crash locations, pop-up details, user-controlled filters, and statistical insights on contributing factors, 
            high-risk intersections, and accident trends.
        </p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Seattle Residents:</strong> Allows individuals to assess traffic risks near their homes, workplaces, and frequently traveled routes.</li>
            <li><strong>City Planners & Transportation Officials:</strong> Provides a data-driven approach to improving road safety infrastructure, such as redesigning intersections and implementing new traffic regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Drivers & Commuters:</strong> Helps motorists and cyclists make informed decisions about their routes, potentially reducing their exposure to hazardous areas.</li>
        </ul>
