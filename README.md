Seattle Crash Map â€“ Interactive Web GIS
Visualizing Car Crashes in Seattle for Better Road Safety


## Project Overview
Our group is developing an interactive web map that visualizes car crashes in Seattle using publicly available datasets. This tool provides insights into traffic incidents, allowing users to explore different trends through interactive filtering and visualizations.

## Key Objectives
Increase public awareness of traffic hazards.
Help city planners make data-driven urban planning decisions.
Enable drivers and commuters to navigate more safely.
The interactive map will feature crash locations, pop-up details, user-controlled filters, and statistical insights on contributing factors, high-risk intersections, and accident trends.

## Target Audience
This project is designed for:

ðŸ”¹Seattle Residents â€“ To identify high-risk areas and make informed decisions about where to live or commute.
ðŸ”¹City Planners & Transportation Officials â€“ To improve road safety infrastructure by analyzing accident patterns.
ðŸ”¹Drivers & Commuters â€“ To avoid hazardous areas and plan safer routes.

## Available Datasets

ðŸ”¹Seattle GeoData Portal â€“ General dataset collection related to Seattle traffic collisions. 

(https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/search?collection=Dataset&layout=grid&q=Collisions)

ðŸ”¹Washington Traffic Safety Commission - Focuses on fatal crashes, providing additional context on severe accidents, speed limits, pedestrian involvement, and primary causes. 

(https://wtsc.wa.gov/dashboards/fatal-crash-map/)

ðŸ”¹Seattle GeoData Portal (Vehicle Collisions Data) - Contains records of vehicle-related collisions, including crash details such as severity, involved vehicles, and contributing factors.

## Data Processing:
We cleaned and formatted the datasets by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing data, standardizing attributes, and filtering relevant incidents.
Cleaned datasets are stored in the assets/ folder.

## Features & Functionality

### Interactive Web Map:

Built using Mapbox for smooth visualization.
Displays collision locations with pop-up details.

### User-Controlled Filters:

Filter crash data by year, type (vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist), severity, and contributing factors.

### Heatmaps & Clustering

Highlights high-risk areas to identify traffic hazards.

### Data Summary Panel

Provides real-time statistics, such as:

ðŸ”¹Most common crash causes.
ðŸ”¹High-risk intersections.
ðŸ”¹Trends over time.
