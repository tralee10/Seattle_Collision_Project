**Seattle Collision Map** - Visualizing Car Crashes in Seattle for Better Road Safety.

### Application URL
https://tralee10.github.io/Seattle_Collision_Project/index.html

## Project Overview
This interactive web map provides a detailed visualization of car crashes in Seattle, leveraging publicly available datasets to present a comprehensive overview of traffic incidents. By offering insights into crash trends, severity, and contributing factors, the project aims to improve public awareness and assist in data-driven urban planning decisions.

The map specifically focuses on crash data from the years 2016 and 2020 to highlight changes in traffic patterns before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can interact with the map to explore these trends, utilizing various filtering tools and visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into traffic safety issues.

### Key Objectives
This project is designed to achieve the following goals:

* **Increase Public Awareness**: By making crash data accessible and interactive, the project helps Seattle residents better understand road safety risks in their area.
* **Support Data-Driven Urban Planning**: City planners and transportation officials can utilize the insights derived from the data to enhance infrastructure and implement safety measures.
* **Improve Road Safety for Drivers and Commuters**: By identifying high-risk intersections and common crash causes, the project allows drivers to make informed decisions about their routes and behaviors.

The interactive map provides a variety of functionalities, including:

* Crash location visualization with interactive pop-ups displaying crash details.
* User-controlled filters for customizing the displayed data.
* Heatmaps and clustering to highlight high-risk areas.
* A data summary panel showcasing key statistics, trends, and safety insights.

### Target Audience
The Seattle Collision Map is designed for a diverse set of users who benefit from its insights:

* **Seattle Residents**: Allows individuals to assess traffic risks near their homes, workplaces, and frequently traveled routes.
* **City Planners & Transportation Officials**: Provides a data-driven approach to improving road safety infrastructure, such as redesigning intersections and implementing new traffic regulations.
* **Drivers & Commuters**: Helps motorists and cyclists make informed decisions about their routes, potentially reducing their exposure to hazardous areas.
* **Researchers & Data Analysts**: Offers valuable data for further studies on urban mobility, accident patterns, and public safety.



## Features & Functionality

This web application is built using Mapbox to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.

### Interactive Web Map:

* **Crash Point Visualization**: Accidents are displayed on the map with color-coded markers that indicate severity levels, allowing users to identify high-risk locations at a glance.
* **Pop-up Details**: Clicking on a crash marker provides detailed information, including the date, severity, type of collision, and specific location.

### User-Controlled Filters:

* **Dot-Density Map & Heatmap Toggle**: Users can switch between a dot-density representation of crashes and a heatmap that highlights accident hotspots.
* **Time Slider**: Allows users to compare crash data between 2016 and 2020 to observe changes over time.
* **Crash Type Filter**: Users can filter crashes based on the type of incident, such as vehicle-only accidents, pedestrian-involved crashes, or cyclist collisions.
* **Severity Filter**: Allows filtering of crashes based on severity, distinguishing between minor, serious, and fatal incidents.

### Heatmaps & Clustering:

* **Accident-Prone Areas**: The heatmap visualizes locations with a high concentration of crashes, making it easier to identify dangerous intersections and road segments.
* **Pattern Recognition**: Helps reveal trends in crash frequency, aiding in the development of targeted road safety interventions.

### Data Summary Panel:

* **Real-Time Statistics**: Provides key insights into the data, such as the most common causes of crashes, the intersections with the highest number of incidents, and year-over-year trends.
* **High-Risk Intersections**: Identifies locations with frequent accidents, which can inform infrastructure improvements and policy changes.
* **Crash Trends Over Time**: Displays graphical representations of accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors, helping users understand how traffic safety has evolved.

### References Button:

**Data Sources & Documentation**: A dedicated button allows users to view a pop-up that lists all data sources, methodologies, and references used in the project.
